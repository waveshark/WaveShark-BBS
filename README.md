# WaveShark BBS

A simple "BBS" for WaveShark written in Python.  Automatically scans for WaveShark devices connected via USB Serial and uses the first WaveShark that it can connect to as the basis for a simple BBS with a basic message wall that users can write to and read from, as well as maintaining a list of "last heard" stations.

Partially meant to inspire other WaveShark users to write their own software to perform various functions using their WaveShark devices (dead drop, safety check-in list, barter point, etc).

## Usage

* python ws-bbs.py
* python3 ws-bbs.py
